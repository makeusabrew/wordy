Always been unsure how to do transitions. Using angular seems to make that easier.

1. Client side has more control. It can dictate where it wants to go without
incessent <-> with server. When it does, it usually does so via a $location.path(foo)
call, which in turn loads a template and controller(s). So far this is all client
side, which is beneficial as it means we *know* the client has loaded the relevant
DOM / controller before sending any messages to it. On init (e.g. in the controller's
constructor) the controller emits a message to the server letting it know it's
ready to receive data.
